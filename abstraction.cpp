This is the driver code that will execute and demonstrate the functionality of
your abstract class `Animal` and the derived classes 'Dog', 'Cat'.

First, the object of the class Dog is created along with the dog name.
Then the Dog class object is used to call the method makeSound() to print the
corresponding text of Dog class.

Next, the object of the class Cat is created along with the cat name.
Then the Cat class object is used to call the method makeSound() to print the
corresponding text of Cat class.


int main() {

    // Input names for dog and cat
    string dName, cName;
    getline(cin, dName);
    getline(cin, cName);

    // Create Dog object
    Animal* dog = new Dog(dName);
    dog->makeSound();

    // Create Cat object
    Animal* cat = new Cat(cName);
    cat->makeSound();

    // Clean up
    delete dog;
    delete cat;

    return 0;
