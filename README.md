# Object-Oriented Programming (OOPs) Projects
**Owner:** Atul kumar Vishwakarma  
**GitHub:** [Atul-Vishwakarma9](https://github.com/Atul-Vishwakarma9/Oops)  

Welcome to my **OOPs (Object-Oriented Programming) projects repository**! This repository showcases my hands-on work with OOP concepts in **C++** and **Java**, demonstrating my understanding of modern programming principles, software design, and real-world problem-solving.

---

## ðŸ”¥ Key Highlights

- Implemented **core OOP concepts**:
  - **Encapsulation**
  - **Abstraction**
  - **Inheritance**
  - **Polymorphism**
  - **Aggregation & Composition**
  - **Interfaces & Inner Classes**
  - **Static Keywords & Object Cloning**
  - **Constructors and Methods**

- Projects demonstrate **practical applications** of OOP principles in coding, making the code modular, reusable, and maintainable.

- Clear and well-documented code, suitable for **recruiters, interviewers, and fellow developers** to explore and learn.

## ðŸ’¡ Learning Outcomes

By exploring these projects, I have learn:

- How to design **efficient and modular code** using OOP principles.  
- Implement **real-world software solutions** using classes, objects, and advanced OOP concepts.  
- Best practices for **code organization, readability, and maintainability**.
