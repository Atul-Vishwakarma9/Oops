This is the driver code that will execute and demonstrate the functionality of
your base class `Employee`, and derived classes `Manager` and `Engineer`.

It creates an object of class `Manager`, and uses the parameterized constructor
to initialize the attributes of both Manager and the inherited attributes from
the Employee class. It then prints a line with the text message "Manager
Details". Then it calls the displayDetails() method of the Manager class which
prints details of the manager.

It creates an object of class `Engineer`, and uses the parameterized constructor
to initialize the attributes of both Engineer and the inherited attributes from
the Employee class. It then prints a line with the text message "Engineer
Details". Then it calls the displayDetails() method of the Engineer class which
prints details of the engineer.


int main() {

    string M_name, E_name, E_specialization;
    int M_id, E_id, M_teamSize;

    // Create Manager instance
    Manager manager(M_name, M_id, M_teamSize);
    cout << "Manager Details" << endl;
    manager.displayDetails();

    // Create Engineer instance
    Engineer engineer(E_name, E_id, E_specialization);
    cout << "\nEngineer Details" << endl;
